* initial release;
* you can define an extendable graph model: 
  - declaring properties
  - vertex and edge types
  - declaring that those types have some properties
  - you can do that in any place and than add some things
* you can provide implementations of those types for a particular db backend:
  - implementation for the TitanDB is incuded in this release;
* you can define a restricted graph schema and create it for the graph implementation;
* _indexes will be in the next release_, so far you can use just the backend-dependent ways of retrieving things;
