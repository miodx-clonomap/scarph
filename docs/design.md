1. Remove containers
2. for implementations, `Stream[A]` with different `A`s can be used as denotations
3. Is then `map`, `flatMap` actually a need?
4. express arities as †-notions, evaluators (or storage) can use that information
5. All the reasonable †-combinators should be expressible in this setting.
6. The need for predicates, equalities, duplications should be encoded in terms of the compact-closed trace and biproduct operations.
